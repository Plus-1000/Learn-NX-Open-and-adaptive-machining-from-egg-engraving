# Learn NX Open and Adaptive Machining from egg engraving
Adaptive machining process can be split into two steps: 
## **1. detect part deformation**  
        Detect part distortion by probe:
        Part deformation can be checked by probe or scanner, here we use probe as example: 

        When probe hit part along Z direction, we can get Z distance of destining point,
        as the  X, Y value defined earlier, we write point 1's X,Y,Z value to txt file.We plan to check 20 points in this step.
        
## **2. generate machining toolpath for CNC or robot**
