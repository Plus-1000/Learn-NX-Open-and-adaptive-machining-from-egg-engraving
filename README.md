# Learn NX Open and Adaptive Machining from egg engraving
The adaptive machining process can be split into two steps: 
## **1. Detect job deformation**  
        Detect part distortion by probe:
        Part deformation can be checked by probe or scanner, here we use the probe as an example: 

        When the probe hits part along the Z direction, we can get the Z distance of the destining point,
        as the  X, Y value defined earlier, we write point 1's X, Y, Z value to the txt file. We plan to check 20 points in this step.

## **2. Generate machining toolpath for CNC or robot**
